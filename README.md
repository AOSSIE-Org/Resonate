With the rising popularity of social voice platforms such as Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, it is high time for an Open Source alternative. A platform like this would not only enhance credibility within the open-source community but also attract more users and foster growth. An engagement platform that is Open Source has the potential to drive significant traction and help establish a strong presence.

## :rocket: Features
1. Real-time Audio Communication by joining rooms and talking to people.
2. Ability to create rooms and moderate speakers and events.
3. Pair chatting to enable users to find random partners to talk to in the app.
4. Real-time messaging(Coming Soon) 

## :computer: Technologies Used

1.  **Flutter** - Mobile application
2.  **Appwrite** - Authentication, Database, Storage and Cloud functions.
3.  **LiveKit** - Web Real-Time Communication
