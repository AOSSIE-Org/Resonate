## Onboarding Guide

### Backend Env 

Git Clone the [Resonate Backend Repo](https://github.com/Aarush-Acharya/Resonate-Backend)
<br/>

> #### **Very Important Info**
> The backend initialisation script installs Appwrite locally with additional custom flags to the install command available in the appwrite documentation so if you already have Installed Appwrite locally please delete the image and the container and start fresh
<br/>

Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal, and run the command
```
./init.sh
```
This will start the backend initialisation script thus start installing the appwrite locally, this may take some time but after a few minutes your appwrite will be successfully installed.

<br/>

Once you appwrite is installed, you will be prompted with login credentials to login to appwrite but first you must go to [appwrite localhost](http://localhost:80)
